# Welcome to Filebeat 7.6.1

Filebeat sends log files to Logstash or directly to Elasticsearch.

## Getting Started

To get started with Filebeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Filebeat with:

     ./filebeat -c filebeat.yml -e

This will start Filebeat and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Filebeat into Kibana, run:

    ./filebeat setup -e
